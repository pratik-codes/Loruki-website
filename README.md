# Loruki-website

## Hi There!
- So this website was made keeping in mind to pratice basic HTML and CSS. 
- I felt like Bootstrap makes us lazy alot hence i wanted to pratice some CSS and hence other than HTML and CSS nothing else was used in building this webapp.

## What is Loruki?
- It is a cloud hosting provider like heroku. I use heroku a lot so now you know where the name of the website came from :D
- It has three page Home - which tells about the company, Features Which givers some stats about the company, Docs - which has documentation on how to use the website.

# The website is up and running [here](https://hungry-kalam-255f5c.netlify.app/index.html)
